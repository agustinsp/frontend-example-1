Code Sample - Backbone.js, jQuery, SASS, RequireJS and Underscore.js
==================

This project was designed as a static App for an internal presentation in an HR department.
All the transitions are made with CSS3 and there are JS triggers that detect the transition-end event. PHP is only used to provide the data abstracted from the front-end code.

The browser requiremnts were IE9+, FF 17+ and Chrome 20+.
